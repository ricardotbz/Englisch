(With Taha and Andrin)

## 1 
We think its really fascinating how low the Security in One of the Major Museums in the World is.  
## 2
If you look closely than i almost would say it was to easy, how is it possible that you can steal jewelery worth 88 Million Euros with a Crane and warning vest?
If you ask me the heist was really dumb because who is gonna buy this stuff? some private corrector that needs to hide it for the rest of its existence?
## 3
Smelt it and sell the Raw Material is also dumb because as far as i know the Value of this stuff doesnt come from the Raw Gold etc. the Value is the History behind it. 
For sure you make a good amount of money if you smelt and then sell but not as much as if you sell it in whole.
