## Have you heard any albums from Pitchfork’s Best Albums of 2025 list (like Los Thuthanaka, Dijon’s Baby, Bad Bunny’s DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, or Oklou’s Choke Enough)?  
Yes ive Heard from Bad Bunnys Album because it was really popular. 

## Which 2025 albums from the list did you listen to, and which one did you like the most? Can you explain why? 
I listened to Playboi Cartis Album "MUSIC" thats the only one from the list that i listened to, but i only like 2 to 3 songs. 

## Are there any albums from 2025 NOT on this list, which you think should be? Which ones, and why? 
Not that i know off, the most of the Stuff that i listen too is "older" than 2025 so i would know a album that released this year. Maybe a EP that one of my favourite German Rappers dropped. Its Called "grünewürfelflow"-Pashanim
