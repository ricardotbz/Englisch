## Should tap water be free in Swiss restaurants?

Tap water should be free in Swiss restaurants because it is a basic necessity and Switzerland has very high-quality drinking water. Making it free would encourage people to stay hydrated and be more environmentally friendly by reducing bottled water consumption. I would personally order tap water more often if it were free, especially when eating out, because it feels unnecessary to pay for something that is readily available and safe to drink.

## Why is there an increase in knife violence in the UK, and why is Switzerland different?

The increase in knife violence in the UK is often linked to social inequality, youth crime, gang culture, and limited access to support services for young people. Easy access to knives and social media can also contribute by spreading fear or glorifying violence. To reduce knife crime, the UK could invest more in education, youth programs, mental health support, and stronger community policing.

Switzerland has fewer violent crimes because of strong social support systems, lower levels of inequality, good education, and a high level of trust between citizens and authorities. Early intervention and a focus on prevention help reduce violence before it escalates.
