**Portfolio Entry #10: Freestyle – Zurich: Switzerland's Vibrant Hub**

Zurich stands as Switzerland's largest city and economic powerhouse, located at the northwestern tip of Lake Zurich in north-central Switzerland. 
With a population of around 436,551 in the municipality as of late 2024 and an urban area exceeding 1.45 million, it serves as the capital of the Zurich canton. 
Not the national capital—Bern holds that role—Zurich thrives as a global financial center, home to major banks like UBS and Credit Suisse

**Iconic Attractions**
- **Old Town (Altstadt)**: Features medieval churches like Grossmünster and Fraumünster, guildhalls, and over 1,000 fountains amid cobblestone streets.
- **Bahnhofstrasse**: World-famous shopping avenue lined with luxury stores and cafes.
- **Lake Zurich and Uetliberg**: Offers scenic boat rides and panoramic views from the nearby mountain.
- **Swiss National Museum**: Showcases cultural history in a castle-like building near the main station.

Zurich blends history with modernity; its Roman roots trace back over 2,000 years to the Lindenhof site, evolving through industrialization into a hub of innovation with ETH Zurich university. 
The city's high quality of life, efficient public transport, and proximity to the Alps attract visitors for cultural events, parks, and architecture like the Freitag Tower made of shipping containers.
Economically strong with a GDP per capita over 83,000 GBP, Zurich faces future workforce challenges but remains a top destination for its stability and diversity.
