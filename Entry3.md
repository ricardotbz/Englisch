# Portfolio Entry #3: Emotions

## Disappointed During IT Training

One time I felt disappointed was last year in my IT class. We worked hard on a network setup project for weeks.  
At the end, the teacher said it didn't meet standards because of a small config error.  
I was gutted – all that time and it failed. It pushed me to double-check everything now.

## Delighted at Openair Frauenfeld

I felt delighted at Openair Frauenfeld festival this summer.  
My favorite rapper came on stage and the crowd went wild – lights everywhere, bass thumping.  
It was pure joy, dancing with friends under the sun. Best day ever!
