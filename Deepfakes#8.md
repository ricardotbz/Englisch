# Portfolio Entry #8: Deepfakes 

## Do you think deepfakes are problematic for society or not? 
Deepfakes are problematic for society because they blur the line between real and fake, making it easier to spread misinformation and damage trust.

## How could deepfakes affect your everyday life or the lives of people you know? 
In everyday life, deepfakes could affect me or people I know through fake videos, voice scams, or misleading social media content that can cause confusion or harm.
## Create and share in your portfolio your own deepfake, and say what inspired you to make it. Keep it classy, and do ask for consent if it is someone you know.  
Didnt give consent, sorry :(
